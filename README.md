# AudioKeepAlive
Application to prevent audio devices with an auto-shutoff from turning off
I got the initial idea from KeepAlive, a program with the same purpose by Bradley Shaner and posted on the Logitech forums.
I liked the concept but found it lacked some usability.  I've used his original sound clip (with his permission) and added
a tray icon for configuring and quitting out of the app.  I use this application regularly so I'll update it with features
as their usefulness outweighs my laziness.

I'd like to add controls for the volume and interval.  Interval is pretty easy, but volume would require me to look into
audio manipulation tools, so that one's not likely to happen.

Feel free to modify and use all included files in any way you see fit.  If you come up with some cool new features, drop
me a line so I can check em out!
